    <h1>Azure Deployment Lifecycle</h1>
    <p>Azure provides various deployment options and lifecycles for deploying applications and services. Here's a brief overview:</p>
    <h2>1. Development</h2>
    <p>In this stage, developers write and test code locally using their development environment. Azure provides tools like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Azure DevOps for seamless development.</p>
    <h2>2. Build</h2>
    <p>Once the development is completed, the code is built into deployable artifacts. Azure DevOps pipelines or other CI/CD tools automate the build process, ensuring consistency and reliability.</p>
    <h2>3. Test</h2>
    <p>After the build stage, the artifacts are deployed to test environments where various types of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) are performed. Azure supports multiple testing frameworks and tools.</p>
    <h2>4. Deployment</h2>
    <p>Once the testing is successful, the artifacts are deployed to production or staging environments. Azure offers several deployment methods including manual deployment, continuous deployment (CD), blue-green deployment, and canary deployment.</p>
    <h2>5. Monitoring and Management</h2>
    <p>After deployment, Azure provides monitoring tools such as Azure Monitor, Azure Application Insights, and Log Analytics to monitor the performance, availability, and health of applications and services. Continuous monitoring and management help in identifying and resolving issues quickly.</p>
    <h2>6. Scaling and Optimization</h2>
    <p>Azure allows scaling applications horizontally or vertically based on demand using services like Azure Autoscale and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Optimization techniques such as cost management, performance tuning, and resource right-sizing help in maximizing the efficiency and reducing costs.</p>
    <h2>7. Decommissioning</h2>
    <p>Eventually, when an application or service is no longer needed, it is decommissioned from Azure resources. Proper decommissioning ensures that resources are released efficiently and securely.</p>
    <p>These are the key stages of the deployment lifecycle in Azure. Effective management and automation throughout these stages are crucial for delivering high-quality applications and services.</p>
